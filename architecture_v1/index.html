<p>Section 1 : Purpose &amp; Scope</p>
<ol>
<li>Purpose</li>
</ol>
<p>The system is a regulated deterministic governance platform designed to serve as a foundational decision backbone for organizations and critical processes.</p>
<p>Its purpose is to:</p>
<p>Execute decision processes using only explicit, human-authored logic.</p>
<p>Record all authoritative decisions as immutable, auditable facts.</p>
<p>Provide full, reconstructable explanations for every decision.</p>
<p>Enforce strong human authority over all system evolution.</p>
<p>Act as a safe boundary between automated reasoning and real-world action.</p>
<p>The system is intended to be used as:</p>
<p>A Decision Backbone for structured decision-making.</p>
<p>A Compliance Engine for enforceable governance rules.</p>
<p>A Legal Memory for authoritative, non-repudiable records.</p>
<p>A Safe AI Boundary where AI may assist in design and simulation but never act as an autonomous authority.</p>
<ol>
<li>Scope</li>
</ol>
<p>The system governs decision logic, not general computation.</p>
<p>It is scoped to:</p>
<p>Deterministic evaluation of predefined decision processes.</p>
<p>Human-in-the-loop escalation where deterministic outcomes cannot be derived.</p>
<p>Cryptographically verifiable recording of decisions and processes.</p>
<p>Logical replay and reconstruction of past decisions for audit and explanation.</p>
<p>The system operates under the principle that no outcome may be produced unless it is explicitly permitted by prior human-authored logic.</p>
<ol>
<li>Out of Scope</li>
</ol>
<p>The system does not:</p>
<p>Perform open-ended optimization or inference.</p>
<p>Learn or modify its own decision logic.</p>
<p>Generate new rules, policies, or outcomes autonomously.</p>
<p>Act as a general-purpose workflow engine.</p>
<p>Execute real-world actions directly without human authorization.</p>
<p>AI components may be used only for design assistance, simulation, and explanation.
They are never a source of authority and never a source of truth.</p>
<ol>
<li>Authority Boundary</li>
</ol>
<p>The system itself is the authoritative source of internal truth.</p>
<p>However:</p>
<p>All system behavior is defined and controlled by humans.</p>
<p>All changes to system logic require explicit human approval.</p>
<p>The system enforces its own constraints and must fail closed if consistency or authority cannot be established.</p>
<p>The system is governed by humans, but not mutable by humans without trace.</p>
<hr />
<p>Section 2 : Core Ontology (draft v1)</p>
<ol>
<li>Ontological Scope</li>
</ol>
<p>The system defines a closed and explicit ontology of internal entities.</p>
<p>Only entities defined within this ontology are permitted to exist inside the system.
No implicit, dynamic, or ad-hoc entity types are allowed.</p>
<p>All entities are:</p>
<p>First-class.</p>
<p>Explicitly typed.</p>
<p>Immutable once created.</p>
<p>Identified by content-derived cryptographic identity.</p>
<ol>
<li>Classes of Entities</li>
</ol>
<p>The system’s ontology consists of two fundamental classes:</p>
<p>a) Factual Entities</p>
<p>Factual entities represent what actually happened.</p>
<p>They include records such as:</p>
<p>Decisions made by the system.</p>
<p>Execution steps taken during a process.</p>
<p>Escalations and their resolutions.</p>
<p>Operational events.</p>
<p>Factual entities are historical truth.
They are never edited, never deleted, and never reinterpreted.</p>
<p>b) Definitional Entities</p>
<p>Definitional entities represent the logic that governs system behavior.</p>
<p>They include records such as:</p>
<p>Decision points.</p>
<p>Preconditions.</p>
<p>Escalation rules.</p>
<p>Intent skeletons.</p>
<p>Schemas and record definitions.</p>
<p>Definitional entities determine how future decisions may be evaluated.
They do not retroactively affect past factual entities.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ontology Closure Principle</li>
</ol>
<p>The set of entity types in the system is strictly limited and closed.</p>
<p>No new fundamental entity types may be introduced dynamically.</p>
<p>Changes to the ontology itself are treated as system evolution and require the same human-approved change process as any other core logic change.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dual-Truth Principle</li>
</ol>
<p>The system treats both:</p>
<p>Facts (what happened), and</p>
<p>Process traces (how it happened)</p>
<p>as equally real and first-class.</p>
<p>Neither is derived from the other.
Both are stored explicitly, immutably, and independently.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identity Principle</li>
</ol>
<p>Every entity in the system has a content-derived cryptographic identity.</p>
<p>The identity is computed as a hash of the canonical serialization of the entity’s contents.</p>
<p>Any change to content produces a different identity.
Tampering is detectable at the object level.
Replay does not require trusting storage.</p>
<hr />
<p>Section 3 : Authority &amp; Identity Model (draft v1)</p>
<ol>
<li>Authority Model</li>
</ol>
<p>The system operates under a strict human authority model.</p>
<p>No internal component, automated process, or AI system is ever considered an authority.</p>
<p>All authoritative decisions originate from humans and are recorded explicitly by the system.</p>
<p>The system may evaluate logic and enforce constraints, but it never originates authority.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identity Model</li>
</ol>
<p>The system itself is the ultimate authority for internal identity.</p>
<p>All human identities are:</p>
<p>Created and managed inside the system.</p>
<p>Authenticated using system-managed cryptographic keys.</p>
<p>Verified using a single, consistent trust boundary.</p>
<p>The system does not delegate identity verification to external authorities and does not mix multiple identity sources at runtime.</p>
<ol>
<li>Equality of Human Identities</li>
</ol>
<p>Within a single running system:</p>
<p>All human identities are verified in exactly the same way.</p>
<p>No human role is inherently trusted.</p>
<p>All human actions are cryptographically signed and auditable.</p>
<p>Roles define permissions, not trust.</p>
<ol>
<li>Non-Repudiation</li>
</ol>
<p>All authoritative human actions are:</p>
<p>Cryptographically signed.</p>
<p>Verifiable by the system.</p>
<p>Non-repudiable.</p>
<p>The system can always prove:</p>
<p>Who performed an action.</p>
<p>What action was performed.</p>
<p>Under which logic version it was evaluated.</p>
<ol>
<li>Insider Threat Model</li>
</ol>
<p>The system’s threat model includes:</p>
<p>External attackers.</p>
<p>Malicious insiders.</p>
<p>Multiple insiders colluding.</p>
<p>No human role is assumed to be benign by default.</p>
<p>Security mechanisms must ensure:</p>
<p>All actions are fully auditable.</p>
<p>Tampering is detectable.</p>
<p>No group of humans can silently subvert system truth.</p>
<hr />
<p>Section 4 : Registry &amp; Event Store Model (draft v1)</p>
<ol>
<li>Source of Truth</li>
</ol>
<p>The system maintains a logically single registry as its authoritative source of truth.</p>
<p>All canonical records exist only within this registry.</p>
<p>No component outside the registry is considered a source of truth.</p>
<ol>
<li>Append-Only Semantics</li>
</ol>
<p>The registry is strictly append-only.</p>
<p>Once a record is written:</p>
<p>It is never modified.</p>
<p>It is never deleted.</p>
<p>It is never overwritten.</p>
<p>All system evolution occurs only by appending new records.</p>
<ol>
<li>Logical Singularity, Physical Distribution</li>
</ol>
<p>The registry is physically distributed across multiple replicas for availability and resilience.</p>
<p>However, it behaves as a logically single source of truth.</p>
<p>If replicas diverge, disagree, or cannot establish consistency:</p>
<p>The system must fail closed.</p>
<p>No new records may be accepted.</p>
<p>Processing must stop until consistency is restored.</p>
<ol>
<li>Multiple Typed Logs</li>
</ol>
<p>The registry is organized as multiple explicit append-only logs.</p>
<p>Each log corresponds to a distinct class of record, such as:</p>
<p>Decision events.</p>
<p>Execution traces.</p>
<p>Escalation records.</p>
<p>Change sets.</p>
<p>Operational records.</p>
<p>Logs are logically separate but causally linked through explicit references.</p>
<p>No single unified log is used for all record types.</p>
<ol>
<li>Registry Authority Rule</li>
</ol>
<p>The Decision Engine must never write canonical records directly.</p>
<p>All creation of canonical records occurs only via the Registry Engine.</p>
<p>The Decision Engine is an orchestrator, not a source of truth.</p>
<hr />
<p>Section 5 : Canonical Record Types (draft v1)</p>
<ol>
<li>Closed Set Principle</li>
</ol>
<p>The system defines a strictly limited and closed set of canonical record types.</p>
<p>Only these record types are permitted to exist in the registry.</p>
<p>No new fundamental record types may be introduced dynamically.</p>
<p>Changes to the set of record types are treated as system evolution and require explicit human approval.</p>
<ol>
<li>Factual Record Types</li>
</ol>
<p>The system includes the following factual record types:</p>
<p>DecisionEvent</p>
<p>ExecutionTrace</p>
<p>EscalationRecord</p>
<p>OperationalRecord</p>
<p>These represent what actually happened in the system.</p>
<p>They are immutable, append-only, and content-hash identified.</p>
<ol>
<li>Definitional Record Types</li>
</ol>
<p>The system includes the following definitional record types:</p>
<p>DecisionPoint</p>
<p>Precondition</p>
<p>EscalationRule</p>
<p>IntentSkeleton</p>
<p>ChangeSet</p>
<p>These represent the logic and structure that govern future behavior.</p>
<p>They are immutable, append-only, and content-hash identified.</p>
<ol>
<li>Schema Strictness</li>
</ol>
<p>All canonical record types have strict, fully normalized schemas.</p>
<p>For each record type:</p>
<p>Only explicitly defined fields are allowed.</p>
<p>Unknown or extension fields are forbidden.</p>
<p>Records with invalid schema are rejected.</p>
<ol>
<li>Referential Integrity</li>
</ol>
<p>All canonical records must reference only existing canonical records.</p>
<p>Records containing invalid, missing, or inconsistent references are invalid and must be rejected.</p>
<ol>
<li>Validation and Consensus</li>
</ol>
<p>A canonical record is considered valid only if:</p>
<p>Its schema is valid.</p>
<p>All references are valid.</p>
<p>All required signatures are valid.</p>
<p>All replicas reach unanimous consensus.</p>
<p>If any of these conditions fail, the record must not be accepted.</p>
<hr />
<p>Section 6 : Decision Semantics (draft v1)</p>
<ol>
<li>Decision Definition</li>
</ol>
<p>A decision is any authoritative determination made by the system at a defined decision point.</p>
<p>Every decision is recorded as a DecisionEvent.</p>
<p>There is no special distinction between intermediate and final decisions.</p>
<p>All decisions are first-class.</p>
<ol>
<li>Deterministic Evaluation</li>
</ol>
<p>For any given input, the system may only apply predefined, human-authored logic.</p>
<p>The system must never infer, optimize, or compute outcomes not explicitly specified.</p>
<p>If no deterministic outcome can be derived from written logic, the system must escalate to human authority.</p>
<ol>
<li>Decision Event Structure</li>
</ol>
<p>A DecisionEvent includes:</p>
<p>The decision point at which it occurred.</p>
<p>The intent context under which it was evaluated.</p>
<p>The outcome selected.</p>
<p>A structured reason code chosen from a human-defined enum.</p>
<p>A reference to the execution trace on which it is based.</p>
<p>Cryptographic signatures.</p>
<p>A DecisionEvent does not include:</p>
<p>Free-text justification.</p>
<p>Embedded data.</p>
<p>Explicit timestamps.</p>
<p>Identity of the decision-maker.</p>
<ol>
<li>Reason Codes</li>
</ol>
<p>Reason codes represent categories of justification.</p>
<p>They are controlled, human-defined enums.</p>
<p>They do not contain explanations themselves.</p>
<p>Full explanations are derived from execution traces and definitional logic.</p>
<ol>
<li>Temporal Semantics</li>
</ol>
<p>A DecisionEvent does not contain an explicit timestamp.</p>
<p>Temporal ordering is derived from:</p>
<p>Append-only ledger position.</p>
<p>Cryptographic signatures.</p>
<p>Time is not stored as semantic content inside the decision itself.</p>
<hr />
<p>Section 7 : Execution &amp; Replay Semantics (draft v1)</p>
<ol>
<li>Execution Model</li>
</ol>
<p>System execution is represented as a sequence of immutable execution traces.</p>
<p>Each ExecutionTrace represents a single step or transition in a decision process.</p>
<p>Execution is append-only and strictly ordered by causal links between traces.</p>
<ol>
<li>Trace Immutability</li>
</ol>
<p>Each ExecutionTrace:</p>
<p>Is created once.</p>
<p>Is never modified.</p>
<p>Is never deleted.</p>
<p>References the previous trace in the process.</p>
<p>There is no single growing or mutable trace object.</p>
<p>The full execution history is the chain of trace records.</p>
<ol>
<li>Replay Semantics</li>
</ol>
<p>Replay is purely logical and internal.</p>
<p>Its purpose is to reconstruct:</p>
<p>What the system believed.</p>
<p>What decisions were made.</p>
<p>How those decisions were reached.</p>
<p>Replay must never:</p>
<p>Re-trigger external actions.</p>
<p>Cause any real-world side effects.</p>
<p>Modify system state.</p>
<ol>
<li>Escalation Semantics</li>
</ol>
<p>Escalations are first-class governed processes.</p>
<p>An escalation is represented by an EscalationRecord, which includes:</p>
<p>The trigger trace.</p>
<p>The escalation rule used.</p>
<p>The assigned human authorities.</p>
<p>The human resolution.</p>
<p>The resulting decision event.</p>
<p>The resolution trace.</p>
<p>Escalations are not mere notifications.</p>
<p>They are authoritative decision processes with recorded outcomes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Causal Consistency</li>
</ol>
<p>All execution traces, decisions, and escalations must form a causally consistent graph.</p>
<p>No cycles are permitted.</p>
<hr />
<p>Section 8 : Intent &amp; Process Model (draft v1)</p>
<ol>
<li>Intent Context</li>
</ol>
<p>An IntentContext represents a single decision process instance.</p>
<p>It is a snapshot of all relevant state for that process.</p>
<p>Once a decision process starts, its IntentContext is frozen.</p>
<p>No mid-flight input may mutate it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Snapshot Isolation</li>
</ol>
<p>If new information arrives while a decision is pending:</p>
<p>Either a new decision process is spawned with a new IntentContext, or</p>
<p>The current process is aborted and restarted.</p>
<p>Inputs are never merged into an active context.</p>
<ol>
<li>Intent Skeleton</li>
</ol>
<p>An IntentSkeleton defines the executable behavioral template for a class of processes.</p>
<p>It specifies:</p>
<p>Default stages.</p>
<p>Allowed transitions.</p>
<p>Linked decision points.</p>
<p>Linked preconditions.</p>
<p>Linked escalation rules.</p>
<p>An IntentSkeleton is not merely a static ontology.</p>
<p>It is a starter program for how an intent should be processed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Process Determinism</li>
</ol>
<p>Intent processing is fully deterministic.</p>
<p>Given the same IntentSkeleton and the same IntentContext, the system must always produce the same sequence of traces and decisions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Task Semantics</li>
</ol>
<p>A task is a notification or instruction issued to a human.</p>
<p>Tasks are not first-class entities with their own lifecycle.</p>
<p>The system records that a task was issued and to whom.</p>
<p>Task execution is reflected only through subsequent human decisions or actions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Section 9 : Change &amp; Evolution Model (draft v1)</p>
<ol>
<li>Non-Retroactivity</li>
</ol>
<p>System logic changes must never retroactively affect past decisions.</p>
<p>Every decision is evaluated only against the exact logic version that existed at the time the decision process started.</p>
<ol>
<li>ChangeSet Mechanism</li>
</ol>
<p>All changes to definitional logic must be proposed and compiled into a ChangeSet artifact.</p>
<p>The runtime system ingests and applies only ChangeSets.</p>
<p>Direct mutation of core definitions is forbidden.</p>
<ol>
<li>Human Approval</li>
</ol>
<p>Each ChangeSet requires explicit human approval before application.</p>
<p>Automatic application is not allowed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Single Active Version</li>
</ol>
<p>At any given time, there is exactly one active version of system schemas and logic.</p>
<p>Old versions are preserved only for historical reference and replay.</p>
<p>Multiple active logic versions may not coexist at runtime.</p>
<ol>
<li>Immutable History</li>
</ol>
<p>Past definitions are never deleted.</p>
<p>They remain in the registry as historical truth.</p>
<p>System evolution is fully auditable.</p>
<hr />
<p>Section 10 : Security &amp; Threat Model (draft v1)</p>
<ol>
<li>Threat Model</li>
</ol>
<p>The system assumes the presence of:</p>
<p>External attackers.</p>
<p>Malicious insiders.</p>
<p>Faulty or compromised internal components.</p>
<p>Multiple insiders colluding.</p>
<p>No internal actor is inherently trusted.</p>
<ol>
<li>Auditability</li>
</ol>
<p>All actions in the system must be:</p>
<p>Recorded.</p>
<p>Cryptographically verifiable.</p>
<p>Fully auditable.</p>
<p>No action may occur without leaving an immutable trace.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tamper Detection</li>
</ol>
<p>Tampering with any canonical record must be detectable.</p>
<p>Record identity and integrity are cryptographically bound.</p>
<p>Replay does not require trusting storage.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fail-Closed Principle</li>
</ol>
<p>If the system cannot establish:</p>
<p>Consistent registry state, or</p>
<p>Valid authority, or</p>
<p>Valid cryptographic verification,</p>
<p>It must fail closed and stop processing.</p>
<ol>
<li>No Silent Authority</li>
</ol>
<p>No human or system component may perform authoritative actions without being recorded and signed.</p>
<p>There is no concept of implicit trust.</p>
<p>All authority is explicit and auditable.</p>
<hr />
<p>Section 11 — Deployment &amp; Operational Model (draft v1)
1. Physical Distribution</p>
<p>The system is physically distributed across multiple independent replicas.</p>
<p>Each replica runs as a separate program or process.</p>
<p>There is no single monolithic system instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Logical Singularity</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite physical distribution, the system behaves as a logically single entity.</p>
<p>All replicas must agree on all canonical records.</p>
<p>There is exactly one authoritative system state.</p>
<ol>
<li>Consensus Requirement</li>
</ol>
<p>The system uses strong consensus with unanimous agreement.</p>
<p>A record is considered valid only if all replicas explicitly agree.</p>
<p>Temporary forks or divergent truths are not permitted.</p>
<ol>
<li>Failure Semantics</li>
</ol>
<p>If replicas:</p>
<p>Diverge,</p>
<p>Disagree, or</p>
<p>Cannot reach unanimous consensus,</p>
<p>The system must stop processing and wait until consistency is restored.</p>
<p>Availability is always secondary to correctness.</p>
<ol>
<li>Operational Records</li>
</ol>
<p>Operational events, both human and system-generated, are recorded as OperationalRecords.</p>
<p>These records are first-class, immutable, and auditable.</p>
<p>They are subject to the same cryptographic and consensus guarantees as all other canonical records.</p>
<hr />
<p>Section 12 : Global Invariants (draft v1)</p>
<ol>
<li>Determinism Invariant</li>
</ol>
<p>For any given input and logic version, the system must always produce the same sequence of execution traces and decisions.</p>
<p>No nondeterministic behavior is permitted.</p>
<ol>
<li>Authority Invariant</li>
</ol>
<p>No authoritative outcome may be produced without explicit human-defined logic and, where required, explicit human approval.</p>
<p>AI components may never act as autonomous authorities.</p>
<ol>
<li>Non-Retroactivity Invariant</li>
</ol>
<p>Past decisions must never be re-evaluated or altered by future logic changes.</p>
<p>Historical truth is immutable.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identity Invariant</li>
</ol>
<p>All actions must be attributable to verified system identities.</p>
<p>Anonymous authority is forbidden.</p>
<ol>
<li>Content-Derived Identity Invariant</li>
</ol>
<p>Every canonical record must have a content-derived cryptographic identity.</p>
<p>Any change to content must result in a different identity.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fail-Closed Invariant</li>
</ol>
<p>If any core invariant cannot be enforced, the system must stop processing.</p>
<p>Partial correctness is forbidden.</p>
