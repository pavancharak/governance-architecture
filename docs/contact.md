# Contact the Builder

This project is not a product.  
It is a long-term institutional research and governance initiative.

The builder is the original architect of the system and acts as:

- system founder  
- constitutional author  
- research lead  

Contact is intended for **serious, aligned use cases only**.


## Who should contact

You should reach out if you are:

- building governance, compliance, or decision systems  
- working in AI safety, policy, or regulation  
- leading enterprise risk or security  
- an investor exploring governance infrastructure  
- a researcher interested in deterministic systems  

This is not for:

- sales pitches  
- recruitment spam  
- generic networking  


## Why contact

Valid reasons to contact include:

- discussing real-world deployment  
- collaborating on governance frameworks  
- contributing research or standards work  
- institutional partnerships  
- legal or policy applications

## Communication principles

All communication should follow the same principles as the system:

Unstructured or vague outreach will be ignored.


## Note

This project is intentionally slow, deliberate, and non-commercial by default.

The goal is not growth.  
The goal is **correct governance**.
