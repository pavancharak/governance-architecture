# Contact

This is a **commercial governance infrastructure product** designed for deployment in regulated and high‑consequence environments.

We work with organizations that are concerned with **safety, accountability, and decision authority** in AI‑powered systems.


## Who should contact us

Contact us if you are responsible for **regulatory compliance, risk, safety, or decision governance** within your organization. This may be a dedicated function or a single team embedded within a larger enterprise.

Typical roles and teams include:

* compliance, regulatory affairs, or risk management
* AI governance, model risk, or responsible AI teams
* security, safety, or internal audit functions
* legal, policy, or enterprise architecture groups
* founders or technical leaders accountable for regulated deployments
* **investors and funds focused on deep-tech, infrastructure, or governance-critical systems**
* **government bodies or public-sector institutions interested in supporting, piloting, or advancing deterministic governance for AI**

You do not need to represent the entire organization. Engagement often starts with **one department or accountable owner** tasked with making AI systems defensible.


## How we are different

We do not offer:

* model evaluations or benchmarking
* ethics checklists or policy documents
* post-hoc explanations of opaque systems

We build **decision authority infrastructure**.

Our work focuses on:

* separating AI intelligence from decision authority
* enforcing deterministic, auditable decision logic
* making authority explicit, attributable, and contestable
* ensuring AI can be deployed in regulated environments without becoming a source of uncontrolled power

If your concern is not model performance, but **who is allowed to decide, why, and under what authority**, then this is the right place to engage.
