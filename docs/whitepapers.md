# Whitepapers

This page hosts the official research publications of the **Deterministic Governance Systems** project.

These papers are **not marketing material**. They are formal position papers that establish how digital authority must be constructed and governed in AI-mediated systems.


## Designing Deterministic Governance for the AI Era

A foundational whitepaper establishing why **explicit intent, explicit authority, and proof-before-action** are mandatory for any system that exercises real-world power.

It presents a unified theory of deterministic digital governance spanning law, technology, institutions, security, and society in the age of AI.

## The Decision Layer

A focused architectural paper defining the **Decision Layer** as a deterministic governance substrate that separates intelligence from authority in AI-powered systems.

It explains how decisions become explicit, attributable, replayable, and contestable without constraining AI capability.

## Reading guidance

These papers are intended to be read as complete arguments. No role-based summaries, selective interpretation, or audience-specific framing is prescribed.

They are written for designers, regulators, operators, researchers, and citizens seeking clarity on how authority must function in systems shaped by AI.
