# Governance Principles


These principles define how the system must behave at all times.
They are higher-level than axioms and guide all design decisions.

## 1. Explicit Over implicit

All system behavior must be explicitly defined by humans.
No hidden inference or emergent logic is allowed.

## 2. Human judgment over automation
Automation may assist, but never replace, human authority.


## 3. Determinism over optimization
Correctness and reproducibility take precedence over efficiency.


## 4. Auditability over performance
Every action must be traceable and explainable.


## 5. Stability over innovation
System evolution is slow, deliberate, and conservative.


## 6. Explanation over opacity
Every outcome must be explainable from recorded logic.


## 7. Law over learning
The system follows written rules, not learned behavior.


## 8. Fail closed by default
On ambiguity, inconsistency, or missing logic,
the system must halt and escalate.


## 9. No silent drift

System behavior must never change without a ChangeSet.


## 10. Authority is always provable
All decisions must be cryptographically attributable.
