# Governance Principles

These principles define how the system must behave at all times.
They are higher-level than axioms and guide all design decisions.

---

## 1. Explicit Over Implicit
All system behavior must be explicitly defined by humans.
No hidden inference or emergent logic is allowed.

---

## 2. Human Judgment Over Automation
Automation may assist, but never replace, human authority.

---

## 3. Determinism Over Optimization
Correctness and reproducibility take precedence over efficiency.

---

## 4. Auditability Over Performance
Every action must be traceable and explainable.

---

## 5. Stability Over Innovation
System evolution is slow, deliberate, and conservative.

---

## 6. Explanation Over Opacity
Every outcome must be explainable from recorded logic.

---

## 7. Law Over Learning
The system follows written rules, not learned behavior.

---

## 8. Fail Closed By Default
On ambiguity, inconsistency, or missing logic,
the system must halt and escalate.

---

## 9. No Silent Drift
System behavior must never change without a ChangeSet.

---

## 10. Authority Is Always Provable
All decisions must be cryptographically attributable.
