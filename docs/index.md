Governance System  : Canonical Index

This repository contains the complete canonical specification of the governance system.
These documents define a regulated, deterministic, human-governed decision platform.
All system behavior, logic, and evolution must be derivable from these files.
No other source of truth exists.

Document Map

1. axioms.md
Foundational, non-negotiable laws of the system.
These are the mathematical and philosophical invariants.
Nothing in any other document may contradict them.

2. ontology.md
Defines what kinds of entities exist in the system.
This is the closed ontology of reality.
If something is not defined here, it does not exist.

3. records.md
Defines the canonical record types.
This is the formal grammar of truth.
It specifies exactly what may be written to the registry.

4. engine.md
Defines execution semantics.
This describes how the system runs, evaluates logic, and produces decisions.

5. escalation.md
Defines human-in-the-loop governance.
This describes how human authority enters the system and how it is recorded.

6. architecture_v1.md
The full system constitution.
This integrates all principles into a single coherent formal model.

7. examples_v1.md
Concrete example executions.
This shows how the abstract system behaves in practice.

8. schemas_v1.md
Formal schemas for canonical records.
This defines the precise structure and constraints of all records.

Authority Model
These documents are authoritative.
All system implementations, code, APIs, user interfaces, and tools must conform to them.
No behavior is permitted unless it is explicitly justified by these specifications.

Change Policy
These documents are immutable.
Any change must be proposed via a formal ChangeSet and approved by humans.
No document may be modified directly without explicit governance.

Intended Usage
This specification is intended to be used by:
System designers.
Auditors and reviewers.
Human decision-makers.
AI systems acting as compilers, simulators, or analysts.
AI systems must treat these documents as the only source of truth.
If something is not defined here, it must be treated as undefined.

Final Principle
The system is governed by humans.
The system enforces truth.
AI assists, but never decides.
